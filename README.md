# EmbeddedC_MiniProjects
Overview
Welcome to the EmbeddedC_miniprojects repository! This repository contains a collection of mini projects that demonstrate my skills and experience in embedded C programming. Each project is designed to solve specific problems or automate processes using microcontrollers and embedded systems.

Projects
Traffic Lights LED Pattern: Designed and implemented traffic light control patterns using LEDs to simulate real-world traffic light systems.

Atmega Timers CTC Mode with Prescaling Template: Developed templates for using Atmega microcontroller timers in Clear Timer on Compare (CTC) mode with prescaling to manage timing operations.

HAL Blink Multi Template: Created a hardware abstraction layer (HAL) template for controlling multiple blinking LEDs, improving modularity and reusability.

Servo Control using Atmega Timers Template: Implemented servo motor control using Atmega timers, enabling precise angle adjustments for robotics applications.

4-bit Binary LEDs Template: Designed circuits with defined pins and delays to display 4-bit binary values using LEDs.

Temperature Level LED Bar Graph: Built an LED bar graph to visually represent temperature levels, enhancing data interpretation.

RGB LED Color and Delay Change using Interrupts: Developed a system to change RGB LED colors and delays using interrupts, demonstrating advanced control techniques.

Software Tools
Wokwi Software: Utilized for simulating and designing embedded systems projects.

Pixelpulse2: Used for circuit analysis and testing.

LT Spice: Employed for detailed circuit simulations and analysis.
